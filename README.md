# 5 Basic Commands to Getting Started with dplyr in R

Dplyr is the equivalent of the Pandas library in R which enables easy data exploration and data manipulation. 

The 5 commands include:
1. Filter (for keeping rows that match some specified criteria)
2. Select (for selecting columns by name)
3. Arrange (for ordering rows in ascending or descending order)
4. Mutate (for creating new variables that are functions of existing variables in the dataframe)
5. Summarise (for reducing variables to a single value using aggregate functions e.g. minimum, maximum, median, mode and mean)
